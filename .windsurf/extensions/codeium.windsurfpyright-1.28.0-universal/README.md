<h1>Windsurf Pyright </h1>

Windsurf Pyright provides language server features, including type-checking and semantic highlighting, for Python in Windsurf. It is a fork of basedpyright, which is a fork of pyright.

This extension is only supported within Windsurf.

Modifications to basedpyright include:

-   Disabling the refactoring code during file renames.
-   Reducing the default strictness of the type checking to better match PyLance.
-   Disabling inlay hints by default to match PyLance, and because they interact with autocomplete. 

Windsurf Pyright uses config settings from pyrightconfig.json, or [tool.basedpyright] in your pyproject.toml.

While we recommend Windsurf Pyright, [basedpyright](https://open-vsx.org/extension/detachhead/basedpyright) or [pyright](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-pyright/pyright) are also functional alternatives.

Our thanks go to the original authors for pyright and basedpyright. The documentation for basedpyright is included below.
